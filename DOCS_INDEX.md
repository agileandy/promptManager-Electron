## Key Concepts Explained

### Application Architecture
The AI Prompt Manager uses a **multi-layered Electron architecture**:

```
User Interface (HTML/CSS/JS)
         â†“
Renderer Process (Application Logic)
         â†“
IPC Communication (Secure Bridge)
         â†“
Main Process (System Integration)
         â†“
External Services (AI APIs, File System)
```

### Core Systems

1. **Prompt Management**
   - CRUD operations for AI prompts
   - Full-text search capabilities
   - Usage tracking and statistics

2. **Hierarchical Tag System**
   - Tree-structured organization
   - Automatic parent/child relationships
   - Smart counting with rollup

3. **Version Control**
   - Automatic versioning on edits
   - Dependency tracking
   - Chain of Responsibility deletion

4. **AI Integration**
   - Multiple provider support (OpenRouter, Ollama)
   - Decorator pattern for response processing
   - Configuration-driven behavior

### Design Patterns Used

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Version deletion handling
- **Command Pattern**: Tag operations
- **Strategy Pattern**: AI provider selection
- **Decorator Pattern**: Response processing pipeline
- **Observer Pattern**: UI updates and event handling

### Data Storage

- **Database**: IndexedDB via Dexie.js
- **Configuration**: JSON files in user data directory
- **Security**: Process isolation and context isolation

## Code Organization

```

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Development Environment
1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run in development mode: `npm run dev`
4. Use built-in Database Viewer for debugging

### Making Changes
1. Follow architectural patterns documented
2. Add unit tests for new functionality
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Test across different scenarios

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Manual testing with real AI providers
- Database integrity validation

## Advanced Topics

### Security Considerations
- Process isolation between main and renderer
- Context isolation for secure IPC
- Content Security Policy implementation
- API key protection and validation

### Performance Optimization
- Indexed database queries
- Debounced search operations
- Virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Memory management and cleanup

### Extension Points
- New AI providers via BaseProvider interface
- Custom tag operations via Command pattern
- Additional response processors via Decorator pattern
- New version handlers via Chain of Responsibility

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **AI services not working**: Check API keys and network connectivity
2. **Database performance**: Use Database Viewer to inspect data size
3. **UI not updating**: Check console for JavaScript errors
4. **Tags not counting**: Verify tag hierarchy integrity

### Debugging Tools
- Built-in Database Viewer (Help â†’ View Database)
- Console logging throughout application
- Electron DevTools for UI debugging
- IPC communication monitoring
