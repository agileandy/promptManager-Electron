# AI Prompt Manager - System Architecture Blueprint

## Executive Summary

This document defines the architectural design patterns, system integration strategies, and component relationships for four critical improvements to the AI Prompt Manager Electron application. The focus is on architectural decisions, design patterns, and system boundaries rather than implementation details.

## System Architecture Overview

### Current Architecture Analysis

The AI Prompt Manager follows a **layered architecture pattern** with clear separation between:
- **Presentation Layer**: Electron renderer process with DOM manipulation
- **Business Logic Layer**: Tag management, version control, and configuration services
- **Data Access Layer**: IndexedDB abstraction through Dexie.js
- **Infrastructure Layer**: File system operations and IPC communication

### Architectural Principles

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each improvement addresses a distinct architectural domain
2. **Event-Driven Design**: User interactions trigger cascading system events
3. **Data Immutability**: Version history maintains immutable state transitions
4. **Service Isolation**: Independent services for tags, versions, and configuration
5. **Cross-Process Communication**: IPC patterns for main/renderer coordination

### Data Architecture Patterns

        M[Settings UI Components] --> I
    end
```

## Improvement 1: Tag Modification Architecture

### Design Pattern: Command Pattern with State Isolation

**Architectural Challenge**: Current system couples tag modifications with version creation, violating single responsibility principle and creating unnecessary data proliferation.

**Design Solution**: Implement **Command Pattern** with **State Isolation** to separate tag operations from content versioning.

### Component Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Tag Management Architecture"
        A[Tag Command Interface] --> B[Tag Modification Command]
        A --> C[Tag Creation Command]
        A --> D[Tag Deletion Command]

        B --> E[Tag State Manager]
        C --> E
        D --> E

        E --> F[Tag Persistence Layer]
        E --> G[Tag Event Publisher]

        G --> H[UI Update Subscriber]
        G --> I[Search Index Subscriber]
    end
```

### Integration Strategy

**Service Boundaries**:
- **Tag Service**: Isolated tag operations without version coupling
- **Version Service**: Content-focused versioning independent of metadata
- **Event Bus**: Decoupled communication between services

**Design Solution**: Implement an **Observer Pattern** with strict **UI Component Isolation** to create a read-only interface for prompt viewing. This ensures complete separation from the edit workflows and maintains data immutability during viewing sessions.

### Component Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Prompt Data Model] --> B[ReadOnly ViewModel]
B --> C[PromptViewerDialog Component]
A --> D[Editable ViewModel]
D --> E[EditModal Component]

C --> F[UI Read-Only Elements]
E --> G[UI Editable Elements]
```
### Integration Strategy

## Improvement 5: LLM Prompt Generation Enhancement

### Design Pattern: Observer Pattern with Decorator Chain Processing

**Architectural Challenge**: Current system prompts sent to LLMs lack clarity in directing the model to generate subsequent prompts rather than explanatory content. Additionally, thinking models that return chain-of-thought reasoning in `<think>...</think>` tags contaminate the final prompt output with internal reasoning processes.

**Design Solution**: Implement **Observer Pattern** with **Decorator Chain Processing** to monitor LLM responses and apply sequential transformations that sanitize explanatory content and strip thinking model artifacts.

### Component Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "LLM Prompt Processing Architecture"
        A[LLM Response Observer] --> B[Decorator Chain Manager]

        B --> C[Base Decorator Interface]

        C --> F[Instruction Clarifier Decorator]

        D --> G[Content Analysis Service]
        E --> H[XML Tag Parser Service]
        F --> I[Prompt Validation Service]

        G --> J[Prompt Finalization Service]
        H --> J

3. **Content Sanitization**: Remove explanatory text and discussion elements
4. **Thinking Tag Removal**: Strip `<think>...</think>` sections from output
5. **Instruction Enhancement**: Ensure prompt clarity for subsequent LLM use
6. **Quality Validation**: Verify final prompt meets generation standards
7. **Output Finalization**: Deliver clean, focused prompt for LLM consumption

### Processing Pipeline Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Decorator Chain Pipeline"
        A[Raw LLM Response] --> B[Prompt Sanitizer]

**ADR-016: Content Pattern Recognition for Prompt Sanitization**
- **Context**: LLMs often include explanatory text instead of direct prompt generation
- **Decision**: Pattern-based content analysis to identify and remove non-prompt content
- **Consequences**: Focused prompt output, reduced noise in generated prompts
- **Trade-offs**: Requires maintenance of content pattern database and false positive handling

**ADR-017: Observer-Based Response Monitoring**
- **Context**: Need real-time processing of LLM responses without blocking generation
- **Decision**: Observer pattern for non-intrusive response monitoring and processing
- **Consequences**: Seamless integration with existing LLM workflow, scalable processing
