Product Requirements Document: AI Prompt Manager
Version: 1.0
Status: In Production
Author: World-Class Senior Frontend Engineer
Date: October 27, 2023
1. Overview
1.1. Product Vision
The AI Prompt Manager is a sophisticated, local-first web application designed to empower users who regularly interact with AI models. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for creating, organizing, versioning, and utilizing a personal library of prompts, streamlining workflows and boosting productivity.

1.2. Target Audience
Prompt Engineers & AI Developers: Professionals who design, test, and refine prompts for various AI models.
Content Creators & Marketers: Individuals who use AI for brainstorming, drafting, and creating content like blog posts, ad copy, and social media updates.
Writers & Creatives: Authors, poets, and storytellers using AI as a tool for inspiration and overcoming creative blocks.
Power Users: Anyone who frequently uses AI and needs an efficient system to manage a growing collection of effective prompts.
1.3. Core Problem & Solution
Users of AI models often struggle with managing their prompts. They are saved in scattered text files, spreadsheets, or note-taking apps, leading to disorganization, difficulty in finding the right prompt, and the loss of effective prompt variations.

The AI Prompt Manager solves this by providing a centralized, structured, and feature-rich database that runs entirely in the user's browser, ensuring data privacy and offline access. It transforms prompt management from a chaotic chore into an efficient, organized, and repeatable process.

2. Features & Functionality
2.1. Prompt Management (CRUD & Versioning)
2.1.1. Create New Prompt: Users can create a new prompt via a modal form.
Required Fields: Title, Prompt Text.
Optional Fields: Short Description, Tags, Folder assignment.
2.1.2. View Prompts: The main view is a responsive grid of "Prompt Tiles". Each tile displays:
Title and Description.
Current Version Number.
Assigned Tags.
Usage Statistics: "Times Used" and "Last Used" date.
Version creation date.
2.1.3. Update Prompt (Versioning): When a user edits an existing prompt, the system creates a new version instead of overwriting the old one.
The version number is automatically incremented.
This preserves the history of prompt evolution, allowing users to revert to or reference prior successful versions.
2.1.4. Delete Prompt: Deleting a prompt is a destructive action that removes the prompt and all of its associated versions from the database after a user confirmation.
2.2. Organization & Filtering
2.2.1. Hierarchical Folders:
Users can create a nested folder structure in the sidebar for intuitive organization.
Full CRUD (Create, Rename, Delete) is available for user-created folders.
A folder must be empty of all prompts before it can be deleted.
The system includes two special, non-deletable root-level views: "All Prompts" and "Uncategorized".
2.2.2. Search: A global search bar allows users to instantly filter prompts by matching text in the title, description, or prompt text.
2.2.3. Filtering: Users can filter the prompt grid by selecting a folder or a specific tag from a dropdown menu.
2.2.4. Sorting: Prompts can be sorted by:
Name (A-Z, Z-A)
Most Used
Recently Used
Date Created (Newest, Oldest)
2.2.5. Pagination: If the number of filtered prompts exceeds the page limit (e.g., 12), pagination controls are displayed for easy navigation.
2.3. Advanced Prompt Features
2.3.1. Prompt Templating:
Users can define dynamic variables in their prompt text using {{variable_name}} syntax.
Prompts with variables are identified as "Templates".
When a user clicks "Use Template," a modal appears with input fields for each variable.
Upon completion, the final text with filled variables is copied to the clipboard.
2.3.2. Usage Tracking: The system automatically tracks prompt usage. The "Times Used" count and "Last Used At" timestamp are updated whenever a prompt is:
Copied directly.
Used via the "Use Template" feature.
Sent for AI Generation.
2.3.3. Version History:
A "History" icon appears on prompt tiles that have more than one version.
Clicking this opens a modal listing all versions of the prompt, newest first.
Users can view the full details and copy the text of any previous version.
2.4. AI Integration (Pluggable)
2.4.1. AI Generation Flow:
Users can initiate text generation by clicking a "Generate with AI" icon on any prompt tile.
If the prompt is a template, the user is first guided through the template-filling modal. The resulting text is then used for generation.
An "AI Generation Modal" provides the interface for the AI interaction, showing the input prompt, a generate button, a loading state, and the final output text.
The generated output can be easily copied to the clipboard.
2.4.2. Configurable Backend: The AI integration is designed to be pluggable. The current implementation connects to a local Ollama instance but can be adapted for other services.
Configuration: The system requires environment variables to specify the AI service's API endpoint and the desired model name.
Error Handling: The UI provides clear, user-friendly error messages if the environment variables are not set, the AI service is unreachable, the model is not found, or any other API error occurs.
2.5. Data Management & User Experience
2.5.1. Data Storage: All data is stored locally in the browser's IndexedDB, ensuring user privacy and enabling full offline functionality for all features except AI generation.
2.5.2. Import/Export:
Export: Users can download a full backup of their prompts and folders as a single JSON file.
Import: Users can restore their data from a backup file. This is a destructive action that replaces all existing data and requires explicit user confirmation.
2.5.3. Theming: The application supports both Light and Dark themes, with the user's preference saved locally.
2.5.4. Help System: A comprehensive help modal is available, featuring:
A User Guide explaining all features for non-technical users.
An Advanced Info section detailing the technical aspects of data storage and AI configuration for power users.
2.5.5. Responsive Design: The UI is fully responsive and optimized for a seamless experience on devices ranging from mobile phones to large desktop monitors.
3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1. Performance: The application must remain fast and responsive, with efficient data filtering and rendering, even when managing thousands of prompts.
3.2. Privacy: As a local-first application, no user data (prompts, folders, etc.) should be transmitted to any external server, with the sole exception of the user-initiated request to their configured AI service endpoint.
3.3. Offline Capability: All core functionalities—creating, viewing, editing, and organizing prompts—must be fully functional without an internet connection.
3.4. Browser Compatibility: Must function correctly on the latest versions of major evergreen browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
