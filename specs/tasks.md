## Epic 1: Tag Modification Architecture

- [x] **Task 1: Implement Tag Command Interface and Core Commands** - Create TagCommandInterface with three command classes (CreateTagCommand, DeleteTagCommand, RenameTagCommand) using Command Pattern with State Isolation to decouple tag operations from content versioning
- [x] **Task 2: Tag Modal Interface Implementation** - Design and implement a Tag UI Modal component per ADR-001 requirements distinct from existing versioning-coupled workflows
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create HTML partial for TagModal component
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Integrate TagModal with TagOnlyManager command execution

## Epic 4: LLM Prompt Generation Enhancement

- [x] **Task 1: Implement Decorator Chain Manager for LLM Response Processing**
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Create BaseDecorator interface for filter implementations
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Implement DecoratorChainManager to manage processing pipeline
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Integrate with OpenRouterProvider for automatic response processing
  - [x] Subtask 1.4: Create test implementation to demonstrate functionality
- [x] **Task 2: Implement Response Sanitization Decorator** *(Completed 11/07/2025)*
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create decorator to remove explanatory text from LLM responses
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Implement detection of explanation patterns and markers
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Add configuration options for sanitization levels
  - [x] Implementation Notes:
    - Created `ResponseSanitizationDecorator.js` with configurable tag removal
    - Focused on XML tag removal as the primary sanitization method
    - Added comprehensive test suite in `ResponseSanitizationDecorator.test.js`
    - Integrated with `DecoratorChainManager` for automatic processing
- [x] **Task 3: Implement XML Tag Stripping Decorator** *(Completed 11/07/2025)*
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Create decorator to remove XML tags from LLM responses
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Implement robust XML parsing to handle nested tags
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Add configuration for tag whitelist/blacklist
  - [x] Implementation Notes:
    - Combined with Response Sanitization Decorator for efficiency
    - Handles nested XML tags correctly
    - Supports configurable tag lists for removal
    - Preserves code blocks when needed
- [x] **Task 4: Implement Instruction Clarity Enhancement** *(Completed 11/07/2025)*
  - [x] Subtask 4.1: Enhance instruction clarity in LLM responses
  - [x] Subtask 4.2: Implement formatting of instruction patterns
  - [x] Subtask 4.3: Add configuration for formatting preferences
  - [x] Implementation Notes:
    - Used a simplified approach by enhancing system prompts instead of creating a decorator
    - Updated system prompts to instruct LLMs to format responses with clear, numbered steps
    - Added explicit instructions for outcome-focused and measurable steps
    - Implemented in ConfigManager.js for both generation and optimization prompts
